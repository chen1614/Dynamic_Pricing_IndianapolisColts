# dynamic_pricing
We partnered with the Indianapolis Colts to work on maximizing their single-game tickets revenue. We develoepd a dynamic pricing model that  optimized the prices based on opponent and time. 
There are two phases to the model, first is the predictive model used to forecast the demand of a game, the results from this model would generate probability of each ticket sold. The result was used to compute the expected revenue in the revenue optimization phase using re-iterative method.
